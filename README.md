# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe meets strategy.

This game was invented by a friend in college. It can be played on paper, on a whiteboard, or now, on a computer.

It's Nine tic-tac-toe boards with one major strategy change: Your move decides what board your opponent gets to use.

This has also been my test project for all the new LLM's coming out. Nothing was able to make this correctly until Gemini 2.5 Pro. I explained the rules and it made it in one shot, then easily added a computer player and retro graphics on request. I'm impressed!

Enjoy.
